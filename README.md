"Digit_Recognization" 
It's a basic and beginner's PROJECT which helps to nourish BASICS of ML model training and testing. 
I am using a predefined model named MNIST dataset.
Description about MNIST:
•	MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a widely used dataset in machine learning and deep learning, specifically for training and testing image classification models. 
•	It consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.
•	Total Samples: 70,000 images
•	Training Set: 60,000 images
•	Test Set: 10,000 images
•	Image Size: 28 × 28 pixels
•	Color Channel: Grayscale (single-channel, values range from 0 to 255)
•	Classes: 10 (digits 0–9)
•	Label Format: Integer (e.g., 0, 1, 2, …, 9)
How does this project help?
•	This project will help you to identify handwritten digit.
•	Once you start running the app.py file, An URL will be generated, Go to the browser "https:// ......", then u can insert ur image and predict.
•	Insert an handwritten digit as an image(jpeg/jpg) file, output can be predicted of that digit.
Technology Stack:
•	Python
•	Tensorflow for deep learning
•	opencv for image processing
•	flask for API building
•	HTML, CSS, JS for FrontEnd development
