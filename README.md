# Digit Recognition

It's a basic and beginner's **PROJECT** that helps to strengthen the **BASICS** of ML model training and testing.  
I am using a predefined model named **MNIST dataset**.

## Description about MNIST
- **MNIST** (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a widely used dataset in machine learning and deep learning, specifically for training and testing image classification models.
- It consists of **grayscale images** of handwritten digits from **0 to 9**.
- **Total Samples:** 70,000 images
  - **Training Set:** 60,000 images
  - **Test Set:** 10,000 images
- **Image Size:** 28 × 28 pixels
- **Color Channel:** Grayscale (values range from 0 to 255)
- **Classes:** 10 (digits 0–9)
- **Label Format:** Integer (e.g., 0, 1, 2, …, 9)

## How does this project help?
- This project will help you **identify handwritten digits**.
- Once you start running the `app.py` file, a **URL** will be generated.
  - Open the browser and go to `"https://......"`, where you can insert your image and predict.
- Upload a **handwritten digit image** (JPEG/JPG format), and the model will predict the digit.
